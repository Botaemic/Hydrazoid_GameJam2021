# Hydrazoid

Game by Botaemic and HReh.

Made for https://itch.io/jam/gamedevtv-game-jam-2021

Theme: All that glistens is not gold.

A roguelite where the traits, perks and pickups may look good but are more than meets the eye.

And in line with the theme... this game is far from finished. 

Hope you'll enjoy the madness!
